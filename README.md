<h1> Shaken Web App </h1>

<P>
  -This project focuses on pointing a web app at the CocktailDB API, returning and deserializing the value of a search parameter.<br>
  -The Data Model breaks down each variable tied to the API, and the Index.cshtml.cs file contains two classes. <br>
     1.) Asynchronously send the API call, receive the data, output it to a list. <br>
     2.) Deserialize that list and make it accessible to the Razor page JavaScript table. <br>
  -That information is then displayed on the razor page as the output of the search parameter. <br><br>
  Remaining Steps: <br>
  - Pass the search parameter into the API call with an ASP-tag.<br>
  - Debug the JSON formatting to output a list rather than a string.<br>
